# Module 06 Challenge - Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This week's Challenge did not include starter code.  The Challenge required that we build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and which uses the OpenWeather API and local storage; the application allows the end user to enter the name of a city, and returns the current weather conditions, as well as the weather forecast for the next 5 days, and which uses local storage to store previously queried cities, and re-execute new queries for those locations.
